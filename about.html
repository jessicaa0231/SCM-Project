        <h3>Why TimeCapsule?</h3>
        <p>
            Because some moments are too precious to lose — and too meaningful to share just yet.
            Whether you're writing a heartfelt letter to your future self, saving a special memory to surprise a loved one, or securing a private message for a later date, TimeCapsule gives you the power to freeze time. It’s not just about storing data — it’s about preserving emotions, stories, and dreams until the perfect moment to relive them.
            With TimeCapsule, you don’t just remember the past — you re-experience it.
